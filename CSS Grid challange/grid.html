            <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects we learned were current, in the company joined, I feel that it's worth every penny.</h2>
            <p>"Definitely room for improvement, especially on the career prep but an amazing program that leaves you excited for a career in web development!"</p>

            <h3>The team was very Supportive and kept me motivated.</h3>
            <p>"I thought the educations was very comprehensive and well presented. I was quite critical of career week, but they have since overhauled their careers team."</p>

            <h2>Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
            <p>"Overall great curriculum. Could be better oriented for Javascript/jQuery. Careers could be better at preparing students. Teachers were phenomenal for the most part. However, the teachers who became teachers right after attending DBC were a hit and miss. With no real world experience, they had little to say about questions that had anythign to do beyond DBC. E.g. "How common is this framework used?" "In a large scale application or company, how would #{so and so} be used?}.."</p>

            <h3>Overall an wonderful experience.</h3>
            <p>"I think the teacher to student ratio could have been better and the cohorts were really large compared to what my friends experienced as little as a year prior."</p>

            <h2>Awesome teaching support from the teachers who did the bootcamp themselves.</h2>
            <p>"One of the most efficient learning environments I've ever been in. Some of the politics around students being asked to leave could be improved Careers could be better at preparing students. Teachers were phenomenal for the most part. However, the teachers who became teachers right after attending DBC were a hit and miss. With no real world experience"</p>
